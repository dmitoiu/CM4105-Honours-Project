## CM4105 Honours Project - Darie-Dragos Mitoiu

![](Docs/33a064e249fd83aec001cf51097e97a0.png)

The CM4105 Honours Project is a Bundle of Machine Learning Experiments written in Python and Java Samples with the
ultimate goal of allowing the creation of a JavaFX Desktop Application that uses the machine learning experiments
to provide accurate predictions related to computer systems failure.
The Application supports Algorithms such as the Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Model, 
Logistic Regression Model and the Multi-Layer Perceptron Model.
