The applications, services and resources of a desktop or a server type of computer system could be organized
and scheduled in a manner which would reduce the impact of the systemâ€™s failure whenever predicted by
making use of right techniques which would fit the equipment in cause and classify specific events that would
occur in computer systems as events that would require maintenance or just as informative events if the severity
of the events is low in order to secure the normal functionality of the machines. \par
\newline
The focus of this research is to try to forecast possible events that could lead to computer systems failure by
reviewing and then selecting the right computer systems failure predictions methods associated with the right
hardware sensors. The ultimate goal of the work presented in this paper is to implement computer systems failure
forecasting features into a desktop application in order to reduce the impact caused by such failure events.
