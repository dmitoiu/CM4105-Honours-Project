As it was seen in the background chapter, a series of interpretations or conclusions were resulted after the
literature review part was completed, these interpretations or conclusions will allow the creation of a
series of aims and objectives in the form of project specifications which will ultimately allow the creation
and execution of the design, implementation and testing of a potential solution presented in the form of
a desktop application for the maintenance of computer systems problem. The ultimate goal of this project
is to provide a solution to the maintenance of computer systems problem by creating a desktop application
which will allow the near-real time monitoring of possible candidate computer systems and provide failure
or maintenance predictions based on the storage system features. This project will focus on the Hard-Disk’s
S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) indicators which can be used in association
with machine learning algorithms such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm in order to provide a
decent result when it comes to failure or maintenance predictions of desktop computer systems. According
to Baldoni, Montanari and Rizzuto (2014) a competent programming language that could solve the problem of
maintenance of computer systems in a predictive manner it is the general- purpose programming language
called Java. This general-purpose programming language was used in solving the maintenance of computer
systems problem in association with the machine learning algorithm called the Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
The initiative of using the general-purpose programming language called Java will be considered but without
the machine learning algorithm called Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as this algorithm is not used in association
with the Hard-Disk’s S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology), instead the Support
Vector Machines (SVM) will be used for this project. The solution provided by this project will be aimed
directly at a specific case of desktop computer system which are used by the institution called Robert
Gordon University. The solution to the maintenance of computer systems problem will be achieved by
completing two distinct stages, each stage having multiple objectives and sub-objectives.
Before starting the design, implementation and testing of the project a series of specifications
will be defined using the MoSCoW system. This system is essential for any software development
project as it allows the prioritisations of the tasks in sections named as “must”, “should” and
“could”. The “must” requirements have to be implemented in order to consider the project a success,
the “should” requirements can be considered as non-crucial elements for the project and the “could”
requirements will be implemented in the ideal scenario.

The first stage will represent the Server-Side or the Command and Control (C\&C) part of the desktop application
which will allow the establishment of connections for possible clients or agents to its address and to
a specific listening port that will be set by the user. Once a number of agents or clients have been
connected to the Command and Control (C\&C) Server, the remote execution of commands for a potential
client or machine that may require maintenance will be possible.

The second stage will represent the Client-Side or the Agent part of the desktop application which
will be created in a dynamic way by the Server-Side or Command and Control (C\&C) Desktop Application.
The Agent or the Client created will ultimately be responsible for sending relevant information to
the Command and Control (C\&C) Server and potentially executing specific instructions on the client
machine which will be sent or instructed by the Command and Control (C\&C) Application.
